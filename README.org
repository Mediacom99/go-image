* Goimg

I need/want to learn Golang so I guess I'll do something with the `image` module in Go's standard library.

* Resources

- [[https://graphicsinterface.org/wp-content/uploads/gi1986-15.pdf][Alan W. Path - Fast Algo For General Raster Rotation]]

* Todo

1. Structure project using go module as library
2. Add parallelization if it makes sense
3. Divide library in multiple source files
4. Web UI with HTML/CSS (export from figma thanks to UI/UX designer collaborator)
5. wasm ?
6. List of things that I could implement:
   - Select zone in image with same color so that I can change the rest
   - Transformation (Rotation, Shearing)
   - Resizing
   - Cropping
   - Flipping
   - Color Adjustment:
     - brightness
     - contrast
     - saturation
     - hue
   - Sepia tone
   - Custom palette
   - Pixelation effect
   - Vintage camera effect
   - Distortion effects (wave, twirl)
   - Edge detection (Laplacian Filtering, Bilateral Filtering)
   - Gaussian blur
   - Radon Transform for Image reconstruction
   - Face recognition / edge recognition
